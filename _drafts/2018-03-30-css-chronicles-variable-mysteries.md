[Go to _real_ start of article](#intro)

To mark the beginning of a new month, I decided to equip myself with new skills on my journey towards becoming an exceptional designer. Naively, I decided to conquer CSS. All of it. One. Property. Atatime. Turns out one does not simply learn all of CSS, but one can try. And so begins the journey towards CSS Mastery. First up: CSS Variables...

### Intro

CSS Variables are actually a combination of two CSS features:

* [Custom Properties](#custom-properties)
* [var() function](#var-function)
* [Fallbacks](#fallbacks)

If you're from the Object-Oriented Programming world, think of ```Custom properties``` as _setters_ and the ```var()``` function as a _getter_. If you're not from that world then... read on.

#### Custom Properties

Are a CSS3 feature that allow you to store values in your stylesheet.
Custom properties are just like normal CSS properties, but prefixed with two dashes and can accept _any_ value you want.
That's right, any value at all. And we'll see how this is both good and bad for you.
But first:

_Syntax_

{% highlight css %}
--property-name: value;

/* examples */

/* value can be any valid css property value */
--main-line-height: 2px;
--main-color: Red;
--default-transition: all 2s ease-in;

/* or a javascript statement */
{% endhighlight %}
**[â¬† back to top](#intro)**

#### var() Function
Used to access the value of a custom property. The ```var()``` function, as defined by CSS, can only be used to access values set by a ```custom property```.

_Syntax_

{% highlight css %}
property: var(--custom-property, [fallback value(s)]?);

/* examples */

color: var(--main-color);

font-style: var(--default-font, Helvetica, Arial); /* 'Helvetica, Arial' 
becomes the fallback value */

/* can also be used to set the value of another custom property */
--header-color: var(--main-color, blue); /* fall back to blue if --main-color
 is not defined */
{% endhighlight %}

#### Fallbacks
Fallbacks are only er.. fallen back to when the custom property in question is not defined. Otherwise, naturally, ```css variables``` are ignored by browsers that don't support them.
So, in the spirit of ```Progressive Enhancement```, you are obligated to include a fallback rule right before the the rule containing the ```css variable```.

{% highlight css %}
color: red;
color: var(--main-color); /* ignored by non-supporting browsers so the color 
remains red */
{% endhighlight %}

How is this useful? I don't know. But a guess is that you could use not-widely-supported css rules along with ```css variables``` and add fallbacks:

{% highlight css %}
body {
    --main-color: rgba(10, 10, 10, 0.7);
}
p {
    color: black; /* fall back for browsers that don't support variables _and_ rgba() */
    color: var(--main-color); 
}
{% endhighlight %}

Congratulations! Now you know ```css variables``` as oppossed to just knowing _about_ them.
Let's look at some cool and not so cool things about them.

#### Cool Things about CSS Variables

1. ##### Less magic strings == Less errors
    You can define all your global variables somewhere (say, in the :root selector where they're accessible from all other selectors) and not have to remember the exact property values you want to reuse.


    {% highlight css %}
        :root {
            --default-transition: all 0.3s ease;
            --borders: 3px solid rgba(10, 10, 10, 0.7);
        }
    {% endhighlight %}

And if you use VS code, the current version's intellisense supports ```css variables``` but doesn't remember what I call ```compound rules``` like the ones above.

The ```:root``` selector in HTML/CSS is like ```html``` but with a higher specificity.

1. ##### Theming
    ```css variables``` make theming a cinch. There are many ways to go about it, but the most straightforward is defining multiple rules for different themes:

    {% highlight css %}
        .blue-theme {
            --primary-color: blue;
        }
        .red-theme {
            --primary-color: red;
        }
    {% endhighlight %}

...and switching between them using a toggle.

1. ##### custom properties cascade

Which basically means that the value of a custom property set lower in the stylesheet is applied:

{% highlight css %}
:root {
    --preferred-color: red;
}

.some-element {
    --preferred-color: blue;
    background: var(--preferred-color)
    /* background will be blue */
}

{% endhighlight %}

1. ##### ...and are inherited too
Which means if we a custom property's value on a div say ```<div class"some-class"></div>```:
{% highlight css %}
.some-class {
    --preferred-color: red;
}
{% endhighlight %}
Then ```--preferred-color``` will be set to red in all the descendants of ```some-class``` i.e ```some-class *```

"Alright alright I got it, so how do I use this?"
When creating multiple rules each just slightly different from the rest:

{% highlight css %}
.one {
  border: 1px solid blue;
}

.two {
  border: 1px solid red;
}

.three {
  border: 1px solid green
}

.four {
  border: 2px solid red;
}
{% endhighlight %}

...you can instead do:

{% highlight css %}
div {
  --div-border-width: 1px;
  --div-border-style: solid;
  --div-border-color: red;  
}

div.one {
  --div-border-color: blue;
}

div.three {
  --div-border-color: green;
}

div.four {
  --div-border-width: 2px;
}
{% endhighlight %}

Which is a very specific example with very little real-life application but at least it enforces DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).
