Satoshi Nakamoto

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSo_EIwHSd4:

is a distributed ledger, accessible to everybody
you can change a block - it's hash will change
each block has its hash and the hash of the previous block
genesis block - has no block of a previous block

recalculating hashes

p2p
proof of work
consensus
smart contracts
=============================
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xGLc-zz9cA:

if a change is made to a block, the change is tracked by a new block

(non destructive ledger)

before a block is added:
- a cryptographic puzzle must be solved
- computer solving the puzzle must share the solution with all other computers in the network (proof of work)
- the network (all other comps) verify this proof of work

"it's not the most sonorous word in the world
"when i'm sending you a pdf via email, i'm sending you a copy of it, and that's fine, this is democratized information"

middlemen (e.g. banks)
-they exclude a lot of people from [the global economy] transactions (like ppl who don't have enough money to open bank accounts)
-they take a big piece of the action (huge cuts to send money and carry out transactions)
-they can be hacked (cause they're centralized)
-slow things down (time to move money through the banking system)
-capturing our data (we can't monetize or reuse it. undermining our privacy)
-they've appropriated the largesse of the digital age asymetrically (we have wealth creation and we have growing social inequality)

but the real pony here... is the underlying technology, blockchain

ethereum (smart contracts)
impact:
-create a new replacement for the stock market
-create a new model of democracy where politicians are accountable to citizens

Applications
"the first era of the internet: the internet of information brought us wealth but not shared prosperity because social inequality is growing" (anger, extremism, xenophobia, protectionism)
-Rather than redistribute wealth, pre-distribute it, democratize wealth creation
- land titles on a block chain (immutable records, protecting people's rights)
- rethinking remittance

"privacy is the foundation of a free society"

How blockchain can transform india
-agriculture: smart records, farm equipment owned by multiple people, managing land records, farming records, output
-electricity: in villages, centralized power stations don't work, you have to produce power where you need it. (donating power from excesses to deficients) (you still need grids to transmit the energy to your peers)
-frauds in 'chamas'

you have an emergency but your car won't open because you're two days behind payment. Simply put: an app won't let you save your life
"the barrier being a rigidity in the structures that don't accomodate real life scenerios well"
"we tend to hold novel technologies to an unrealistically high standard in terms of what they're supposed to deliver"

===================================================
https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/blockchain.asp

a single block can house a few thousand transactions under one roof.

a blockchain can be hacked, but it would require access to every computer on the chain

Each wallet consists of two unique and distinct cryptographic keys: a public key and a private key. The public key is a shortened version of the private key. But it is hard (impossible) to decrypt, hence secure

Wikipedia
1991 by Stuart Haber and W. Scott Stornetta

(Bayer, Haber and Stornetta in 1992) improved the design by includeing Merkle trees (or Hash trees) to allow several document certificates to be collected into one block

Ralph Merkle who patented Merkle trees in 1979

(Satoshi Nakamoto before 2008) improved the design using a Hashcash-like method to add blocks to the chain without requiring them to be signed by a trusted party.

Hashcash is a proof of work system proposed in 1997 by Adam Back

Proof-of-work concept was invented by Cynthia Dwork and Moni Naor in 1992

blockchain reached 'ealry adopters' phase in 2016

"Network effect" - is the effect that an additional user of a good or service has on the value of that product to others. When a network effect is present, the value of a product or service increases according to the number of others using it

private blockchains...
Nikolai Hampton in computer world
-private bc is centralized in a way such that if you control the central bc db, you already have control over the entire bc
-ther is also no incentive to discover blocks faster: "This means that many in-house blockchain solutions will be nothing more than cumbersome databases"

-nodes are...? the computers adding blocks to the network?
-what is 'joining' the blockchain? simply acquiring a copy of the chain?
-where does one receive the challenge from? how does one access the proof of work/stake?
-does a blockchain need a 'heartbeat'? or can less-busy (private) blockchains be configured to a) require no proof work. yes and b) just add blocks whenever a transaction is posted?
-wallets... do you need one to access the chain. This wallet, how complex is it in terms of implementation?
-when i send a transaction via my wallet? who do i send it to? where does the wallet take it? how does it gets processed and added to a block?
-and, for chains with heartbeats, how does the timeline play through? is the proof of work/task directly corelated to the transaction data?
-so at what point (during the heartbeat) do the miners start solving the puzzle?
-"That hash is put, along with some other data, into the header of the proposed block. This header then becomes the basis for an exacting mathematical puzzle which involves using the hash function yet again. This puzzle can only be solved by trial and error"
-does a node know when it has solved the puzzle? or does it repeatedly query..the source? if the solution it has got is the right one?
-"When a miner finally comes up with a solution other nodes quickly check it (that’s the one-way street again: solving is hard but checking is easy)"
-how efficient is blockchain as a database?
-how the fork of bitcoin occurred

AML (anti money laundering) and KYC (know your customer) need to be implemented NOW in kenya as technology is just being adopted so as to ensure people and their data are built into the systems

Enigma uses cryptographic techniques to allow individual data sets to be split between nodes, and at the same time run bulk computations over the data group as a whole. Fragmenting the data also makes Enigma scalable (unlike those blockchain solutions where data gets replicated on every node).

A good blockchain needs to have decentralization and some concept of shared memory e.g. btc: there's ltd amt of btc and everyone owns some btc and we know who owns how many

Bitcoin isn’t secure because of blockchain; it is secure because the effort and cost of subverting its blockchain is greater than the value of what’s being protected. The effort and cost that protect Bitcoin comes in the form of time, computing power and electricity.

more questions
========
how to compromise a blockchain...
What would a hacker do when they have 51% control of all the nodes? would they need to mine every transaction since the inception of the blockchain or can they 'fabricate' a fake history e.g. changing just the last e.g. 2 transactions and copying that new version of the blockchain on to the computers it has 51% control over.
Isn't an attack on nodes the same as a regular attack as in it can be spotted and and therefore stopped or its effects on the blockchain nullified back to the point where there was no attack detected?
